=============

Web based space game done with the Starling Framework.
------------------------------------------------------

How to play
===========

1. Mouse Mode - The easier way to play: use your mouse to move around, and click to shoot.
2. Keyboard Mode - A bit harder to play: ship's gravity is in factor here. Use the Keyboard Arrows or WASD to move the ship. Spacebar to shoot. 
3. Just shoot down the asteroids and the enemy ships. Stay alive until the level ends.
4. You can take laser upgrades and shoot missiles.
5. Don't forget to submit your highscores :)
6. Game still under development, if you find any issues/glitches let me know :)
